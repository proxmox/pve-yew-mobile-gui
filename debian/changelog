pve-yew-mobile-gui (0.6.4) trixie; urgency=medium

  * page login: skip consent banner when OpenID Connect authorization is
    present, as that is the last step in the OIDC authentication flow, which
    means the user has already viewed the banner when loading the UI before
    having been redirected to the OIDC provider.

  * qemu hardware panel: switch back to read-only mode for now.

  * handle fallback enum values when parsing the API response for better
    forward compatibility with new features in the Proxmox VE backend.

pve-yew-mobile-gui (0.6.3) trixie; urgency=medium

  * add support for logging in using OpenID Connect (OIDC) based realms.

  * login: pre-select the default realm configured in the authentication realm
    settings on the Proxmox VE node or cluster.

  * qemu: hardware panel: display any pending changes.

  * qemu: option panel: make all available options editable and show any
    pending changes.

  * storage: fix reversed logic for detect empty content list.

  * improve row height and width layout for all input panels.

  * translation: fix endless loop waiting on catalog load when no language is
    set, in which case no catalog will be loaded.

  * translations: always set the correct language text direction after the
    catalog was loaded.

  * reset button: make default text translatable

  * dropdown fields: reduce the opacity of the placeholder text, which is
    shown when no value is selected, to 50% visibility.

  * infinite progress bar: use purely transforms for the animation, reducing
    stutters or even hanging completely when the main code is blocking for a
    prolonged time (e.g., to process a huge API response).

  * layout: use dynamic viewport height/width units for sizing something to
    the full screen, as on mobile the non-dynamic viewport might not be fully
    visible.
